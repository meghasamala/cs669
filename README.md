# Database Design and Implementation for Business

Throughout this course, I was able to learn how to use ANSI SQL in PostgreSQL through weekly lab assignments, and I was able to design and implement a database from start to finish through weekly project iterations.
Both of these assignments can be found in the respective folders, and my completed database project can be viewed as well.
